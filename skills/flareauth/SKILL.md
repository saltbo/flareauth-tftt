description: Operate a FlareAuth deployment and guide product OIDC client integration. Use this when an agent needs to inspect or change FlareAuth applications, connectors, users, roles, organizations, API resources, webhooks, security settings, branding, sign-in settings, readiness, or configure public SPA, public native, confidential web, or device-authorization OIDC clients.

# FlareAuth

Use this skill for two related tasks:

- Operating a FlareAuth deployment through the Management API.
- Guiding product OIDC clients that integrate with FlareAuth.

For the full Management API Restish command list, read
`references/restish-commands.md`.

## Setup

First identify the deployment origin you are operating. Use the exact auth
origin from the user, deployment repository, Cloudflare Worker, or `/api/configz`
response. Do not guess a production domain from the product name.

On first use, an agent must establish the FlareAuth deployment origin before it
changes anything. `AUTH_ORIGIN` is the FlareAuth deployment origin, such as a
production custom domain or a `workers.dev` origin.

If the user did not provide `AUTH_ORIGIN`, inspect the deployment repository or
Cloudflare Worker configuration when available. If neither is available, ask for
the deployment origin before continuing.

For deployment operations, authorize a Restish profile first. The command
sequence is in `references/restish-commands.md`; use that reference rather than
reconstructing Restish commands from memory.

## Authentication

FlareAuth has a built-in public native client named `flareauth-cli` for Restish
Management API automation. It is not the product OIDC device-login client, and
system-managed applications such as `flareauth-cli` must not be modified.

Ask the user to complete browser login when Restish authorization starts. Do not
ask the user to copy or paste bearer tokens. The authorization helper suppresses
token output and lets Restish store OAuth tokens in its local auth cache.

Do not use product OIDC client credentials for Management API automation. The
Management API accepts an admin browser session or a bearer token issued to
`flareauth-cli`; non-admin users receive `403`.

If the user has already authorized this Restish profile, they can rerun the same
authorization script to refresh the local profile and cached auth.

## OIDC Client Integration

Use the FlareAuth deployment issuer for product clients:

```text
AUTH_ORIGIN/api/auth
```

Prefer discovery metadata instead of hard-coding endpoints:

```text
AUTH_ORIGIN/api/auth/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Common product scopes are `openid profile email`. Add `offline_access` only
when the client needs refresh tokens. Management scopes are reserved for the
system CLI client and are not accepted on ordinary product clients.

Choose the client type by where the application runs:

| Client type | Use for | Secret | Typical grants |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public_spa` | Browser apps that cannot hold secrets | No | `authorization_code`, `refresh_token` |
| `public_native` | Mobile, desktop, CLI, runner, daemon clients | No | `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, device-code grant |
| `confidential_web` | Server-side web apps and backends that can hold secrets | Yes | `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, `client_credentials` when needed |

All authorization-code clients should use PKCE where their OIDC library
supports it. Public clients use `tokenEndpointAuthMethod: none`; confidential
clients use a client secret.

## Creating OIDC Clients

Authorize and sync a `PROFILE_NAME` before running these examples. Distinguish
the FlareAuth deployment origin from the consuming product origin.
`AUTH_ORIGIN` is where FlareAuth runs; `APP_ORIGIN` is the product application's
origin used in OIDC redirect URIs.

Create a public SPA application:

```bash
restish PROFILE_NAME create-application \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -o json <<'JSON'
{
  "name": "Customer Portal",
  "slug": "customer-portal",
  "clientType": "public_spa",
  "redirectUris": ["https://APP_ORIGIN/oidc/callback"],
  "postLogoutRedirectUris": ["https://APP_ORIGIN/signed-out"],
  "corsOrigins": ["https://APP_ORIGIN"],
  "allowedGrantTypes": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "allowedScopes": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"],
  "firstParty": true,
  "trusted": true
}
JSON
```

Create a public native authorization-code application:

```bash
restish PROFILE_NAME create-application \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -o json <<'JSON'
{
  "name": "Desktop App",
  "slug": "desktop-app",
  "clientType": "public_native",
  "redirectUris": ["com.example.desktop:/callback", "http://127.0.0.1:8484/callback"],
  "allowedGrantTypes": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "allowedScopes": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"],
  "firstParty": true,
  "trusted": true
}
JSON
```

Create a public native device-login application:

```bash
restish PROFILE_NAME create-application \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -o json <<'JSON'
{
  "name": "Runner CLI",
  "slug": "runner-cli",
  "clientType": "public_native",
  "redirectUris": ["com.example.runner:/callback"],
  "allowedGrantTypes": ["urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"],
  "allowedScopes": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"],
  "firstParty": true,
  "trusted": true
}
JSON
```

Create a confidential web application:

```bash
restish PROFILE_NAME create-application \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -o json <<'JSON'
{
  "name": "Admin Backend",
  "slug": "admin-backend",
  "clientType": "confidential_web",
  "redirectUris": ["https://ADMIN_ORIGIN/oidc/callback"],
  "postLogoutRedirectUris": ["https://ADMIN_ORIGIN/signed-out"],
  "allowedGrantTypes": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "allowedScopes": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"],
  "firstParty": true,
  "trusted": true
}
JSON
```

For confidential clients, store the returned `clientSecret` immediately. It is
shown only once. Add `client_credentials` only when that backend must act
without a user.

## Device Authorization Flow

Use device authorization only with `public_native` clients.

The discovery document advertises the device authorization endpoint and
device-code grant when supported:

```text
device_authorization_endpoint: AUTH_ORIGIN/api/auth/device/code
token_endpoint: AUTH_ORIGIN/api/auth/oauth2/token
grant_type: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
```

Device flow:

1. Request a device code from `/api/auth/device/code` with `client_id` and
   scopes such as `openid profile email offline_access`.
2. Show `user_code` and `verification_uri` to the user.
3. The user opens `/device`, signs in, and approves or denies the request.
4. Poll `/api/auth/oauth2/token` with the device-code grant.
5. Handle RFC 8628 polling errors: `authorization_pending`, `slow_down`,
   `access_denied`, and `expired_token`.
6. On success, consume the OAuth/OIDC token response. `openid` returns an
   `id_token`; `offline_access` returns a `refresh_token`.

Device-code request:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$AUTH_ORIGIN/api/auth/device/code" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  --data '{"client_id":"CLIENT_ID","scope":"openid profile email offline_access"}'
```

Token polling request:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$AUTH_ORIGIN/api/auth/oauth2/token" \
  -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=CLIENT_ID" \
  --data-urlencode "device_code=DEVICE_CODE"
```

For generic OIDC client libraries, prefer discovery metadata and the library's
device authorization support.

## Guardrails

- Always sync before operating a deployment you have not used recently.
- Always confirm the deployment origin and profile name before making changes.
- Prefer resource nouns and real IDs from list/get responses; do not infer IDs
  from names.
- System-managed applications such as `flareauth-cli` must not be deleted or modified.
- Asset upload endpoints use `multipart/form-data` with a single `file` field.
- Raw secrets are returned only once on creation or rotation; never expect list/detail responses to reveal secret material.
- For large changes, read current state first, apply the smallest patch, then read back the resource to verify.
