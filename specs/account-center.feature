Feature: Account Center
  As a signed-in user
  I want to manage my profile, credentials, sessions, and application grants

    When I click Sign out
    Then I am redirected to hosted sign-in

    Then the new password can be used for sign-in

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:password-policy-native-change
  Scenario: Native password change endpoint enforces managed password policy
    Given a tenant password policy is configured
    When I call the native password change endpoint
    Then weak new passwords are rejected
    And compliant passwords are accepted

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:totp-flow
  Scenario: TOTP enrollment verifies a real code
    When I start TOTP enrollment
    And I submit the current authenticator code
    Then TOTP is enrolled for my account

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:mfa-policy-enforcement
  Scenario: MFA policy controls enrollment and API access
    Given tenant MFA policy disables or requires TOTP
    When I attempt enrollment or protected API access
    Then FlareAuth enforces the current policy

  Scenario: Web3 wallet sign-in follows the SIWE boundary

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:agent-approval
  Scenario: Delegated agents can request read-only account access
    Given an agent requests delegated access through AgentAuth device authorization
    When I approve account profile, session list, and authorized app list capabilities
    Then the agent receives a delegated identity scoped to those read-only account capabilities
    And account mutations remain unavailable through AgentAuth capabilities

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:account-agent-management
  Scenario: Delegated agent access can be managed from Account Center
    Given I have active delegated agents and capability grants
    When I open Account Center
    Then I can inspect the active agents, hosts, and granted capabilities
    When I revoke an agent or a selected capability grant
    Then that delegated access is no longer active for my account
