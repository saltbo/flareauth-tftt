Feature: Admin Console
  As a tenant administrator
  I want Console pages to manage applications, users, connectors, security, and deployment settings
  So that FlareAuth can be configured from the browser

  Background:
    Given a first admin exists
    And I am signed in to Console

    Then issued access tokens, ID tokens, and userinfo include only the configured claims

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:agent-discovery
  Scenario: AgentAuth discovery exposes a narrow delegated protocol surface
    When an agent client requests /.well-known/agent-configuration
    Then FlareAuth advertises delegated mode and device authorization approval
    And the advertised capabilities are limited to read-only account data
    And generated Management API capabilities are not exposed

  @entrypoint:product-ui @journey:admin-agent-inventory
  Scenario: Admins can inspect and revoke delegated agent protocol records
    Given delegated AgentAuth hosts, agents, grants, and approval requests exist
    When Console reads the agent protocol inventory
    Then FlareAuth presents host, agent, user, grant, capability, and approval state from its agent module
    When an admin revokes an agent, host, or capability grant
    Then the revoked protocol record is no longer active
    And no autonomous agent mode or broad admin mutation capability is enabled
