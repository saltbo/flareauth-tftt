Feature: Platform bootstrap and route access
  As a tenant operator
  I want a fresh FlareAuth deployment to guide setup and protect hosted routes
  So that the first admin and authenticated entry points are created safely

  Background:
    Given the Cloudflare Worker is running in E2E mode
    And the D1 database can be reset and migrated

  Scenario: API health reports platform status
    When I request GET /api/health
    Then the response is 200
    And the body reports ok true and service "flareauth"

  Scenario: First admin is created from onboarding
