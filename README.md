Cloudflare-native identity provider built on Better Auth.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/saltbo/flareauth)

FlareAuth is a single user pool auth realm. One deployment can host multiple
OIDC applications when products intentionally share accounts and administrators.
Products that need separate user pools, issuers, administrators, or login policy
should run separate FlareAuth deployments. See
[Tenancy Model](docs/architecture/tenancy.md).

## Stack

- Cloudflare Workers and Assets
- Cloudflare D1
- Hono API
- Better Auth with OIDC provider
- React and Vite
- Drizzle ORM

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run spec:check
npm run test:e2e
```

Code coverage is uploaded from CI to Codecov. Browser E2E status is reported by the E2E workflow; the suite enforces complete declared journey coverage from `tests/e2e/journey-coverage.json`.
Product behavior specs live in [`specs`](specs). Browser E2E tests are the
automation adapter for those specs, and `npm run spec:check` verifies that spec
journeys, declared coverage, and Playwright `attachCoverage(...)` calls stay in
sync.

Check Cloudflare binding coverage before review:

```bash
npm run deploy:check
```

## Cloudflare Environments

The repository uses one Cloudflare Worker and separate staging/production Cloudflare resources:

- Worker `flareauth`
- Production D1 `flareauth-db`
- Staging preview D1 `flareauth-db-staging`
- Production R2 `flareauth-assets`
- Staging R2 `flareauth-assets-staging`
- Production Queue `flareauth-email`
- Staging Queue `flareauth-email-staging`

For another product auth realm, use the Deploy to Cloudflare button again. The
button clones this repository into the operator's GitHub/GitLab account,
provisions the required Worker resources from `wrangler.toml`, and configures
Workers Builds for that product instance.

Use a separate cloned repository, Worker, D1 database, R2 bucket, queue, domain,
and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` for each product that needs an independent user pool.

Deploy production manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Cloudflare Dashboard should own deployments for this repository.

Connect the repository in Cloudflare Dashboard and use:

- Production branch: `main`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Production Worker: `flareauth`
- Preview deployments: enabled for pull requests and non-main branches
- Production D1 binding `DB`: `flareauth-db`
- Preview D1 binding `DB`: `flareauth-db-staging`
- R2 binding `ASSET_BUCKET`: environment-specific avatar/logo storage
- Email binding `EMAIL`: verified Cloudflare Email Routing sender
- Queue binding `EMAIL_QUEUE`: environment-specific email queue
- Cron trigger: `*/15 * * * *`

`npm run build` follows the same pattern as zpan: Cloudflare preview branch builds
use the preview Wrangler config, while `main` and local builds use production
config. Pull requests still run GitHub CI for typecheck, lint, tests, and build,
but deployment and preview URLs come from Cloudflare Dashboard, not GitHub Actions.

## Fresh Onboarding

For a fresh deployment, create the resources, set secrets, run D1 migrations, deploy, then open `/onboarding` to create the first admin from the browser. The CLI helper uses the same onboarding API:

```bash
FLAREAUTH_URL=https://auth.example.com \
FLAREAUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com \
FLAREAUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-long-password' \
npm run bootstrap:admin
```

First-admin onboarding is available only while the D1 database has no users. After the first admin exists, `/api/onboarding/status` returns `{ "required": false }` and `/api/onboarding/admin-users` is locked.

Frontend runtime state is read from `/api/configz`. Hosted auth actions use Better Auth native `/api/auth/*` routes, and product applications should integrate with standard OIDC discovery plus authorization code with PKCE. If a consuming product also uses Better Auth, it can use Better Auth as an OIDC client; product apps do not need FlareAuth management or account APIs.

## Product App Integration

FlareAuth is consumed through standard OIDC, not a product-side FlareAuth SDK.
Use `/api/auth/.well-known/openid-configuration`, then run authorization code
with PKCE against the advertised authorize and token endpoints. Public clients
must use PKCE S256 and the client auth method shown on their FlareAuth client
record; Better Auth 1.6.10 does not advertise public-client `none` support in
discovery metadata while unauthenticated dynamic registration is disabled.
Confidential server clients authenticate at the token endpoint. Better Auth
product apps can register FlareAuth as a generic OAuth/OIDC provider. See
[Auth Provider Architecture](docs/architecture/auth-provider.md#product-application-integration).
